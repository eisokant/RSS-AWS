		<description>Seriously, we have to figure this out. According to CrunchBase SearchMe has 52 employees, which is insane. One product manager, one designer, one AS3 programmer and a few backend developers would have been enough. Come on, I bet they're even using Solr or something similar to index their scrapings.
And don't get me started on the terrible idea of building a visual search engine. When I'm doing my googling I don't care how the pages look like, I just wan't relevant information. And to be honest, in most cases the worst looking pages is the ones with relevant information.</description>

		<description>I would agree with this mentality if Apple wasn't ripping people off with over-priced, glorified PCs.

Seriously, I used to be a fan of Mac when they were a hardware driven system but because Mac is now a software driven computer that uses Intel, why should I pay twice as much for something I can build myself?? If you tell me I should because of their OS then you're smoking crack.</description>

		<description>Mac's are for morons, the comments defending MAC are absurd, the underlying hardware is all intel, the only difference is in software and apps and the minor differences in behaviour.

If you don't do a lot on your computer MAC /w OSX is wonderfull, if you do A LOT on your computer Win XP, or Vista just gives you way more options.

MAC is not a luxury brand it is an excuse to extort money from the technologically clueless and for people who subscribe to superficial externals of form over substance.

All one is paying for with a MAC is case styling in terms of laptop/desktop machine and a logo and the love of being extorted for money.</description>

		<description>If I've got about 1000 euros (say dollars, whatever premium price), I'll totally get more power and speed buying a PC instead of a Mac. I don't need a laser-cutted case and a looming Apple-logo on the back.</description>

		<description>What is their business model? It doesn't look like something that can be monetized using an Adwords or display advertising model. 

How did they spend the $40 million dollars?</description>
